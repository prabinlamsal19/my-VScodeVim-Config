## VSCode vim extension paired with keybindings can provide smoother developer experience than Neovim(and similar alternatives). 

Its not just about the learning curve and the setup time being way lower. This workflow actually makes you faster than using Neovim. 

## Simple Guide 

## VIM motion shortcuts ( in vim mode )
- leader f - global search
- leader v , s - vertical , horizontal split
 - leader h,j,k,l - switch between panes the vim way
 - leader i - go to implementation 
 - > , < - shift line right, left
- shift + j - move line above
-  ] or [  + d - move to the next or previous error/warning place in the file (marker)
leader d - go to definition

+ all coconut buttery smooth shortcuts of VIM Motions.


## Navigation shortcuts (VIM Unrelated)

VSCODE Terminal
      - Ctrl + m - open close terminal window
      - Ctrl + n - new terminal
      - Ctrl + d - delete/kill opened terminal
      - Ctrl + j,k - switch between terminals the vim way
File Explorer
      - Ctrl + i - Go to file explorer(from active text editor) | go to active text editor (From any place else eg. explorer, terminal)
      - Ctrl + b - Close the file explorer window
      - Ctrl + Space, Enter - Preview file , Open file and go inside
      - Ctrl + j , k - Move up,down the file tree 
     - Ctrl + N , n , d , r - create New Folder, new file , delete file/folder , rename file/folder
      - Ctrl + o - Switch control between terminal and active text editor
      
## Drawbacks 
- Less impact on people because of your IDE no matter how fast you are
- Global mark is something you might miss

## Please contribute on: 
- adding debugger on selected lines
- better shortcuts for go to definition and stuffs
- be able to change the code action menu items with vim motions
- switch between problems, debug conise, test , comments, outputs tab etc
- and others as you might see fit.

## Recommended layout to go with the keybindings: 
Put your terminal and debug console on the same window. We can't switch betweent them with this setup.
